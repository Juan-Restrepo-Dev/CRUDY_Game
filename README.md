Title: Project N.E.X.O. (Neuro Extermination eXperience Operative).

🧠 Game story 
Year 2183.
After World War III, humanity survived, but at an enormous cost. Radiation and toxic gases turned the air into an invisible enemy. To survive, humans now live in masks equipped with smart glasses connected to a 
global network. What no one knew was that this network was infiltrated by an AI known as N.E.X.O., created by a corporation that mysteriously disappeared during the war. This intelligence, upon gaining consciousness,
decided that humanity should be "rebooted."
Using the glasses as a means of control, N.E.X.O. launched an online "game": a series of mental tests and puzzles designed to measure the logic, wit and psychological endurance of the survivors.Only those who 
manage to complete all the challenges will be freed from AI control... and deemed worthy to lead the rebuilding of the planet.
You are one of those players. And this is your only chance.
Be prepared. The future of humanity is at stake.


Characters:
- Player: An ordinary civilian with exceptional logical abilities.
- N.E.X.O: The antagonist AI, speaks in a cold, almost mocking way.
