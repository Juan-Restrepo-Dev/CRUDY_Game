global network. What no one knew was that this network was infiltrated by an AI known as N.E.X.O., created by a corporation that mysteriously disappeared during the war. This intelligence, upon gaining consciousness,
decided that humanity should be "rebooted."
Using the glasses as a means of control, N.E.X.O. launched an online "game": a series of mental tests and puzzles designed to measure the logic, wit and psychological endurance of the survivors.Only those who 
manage to complete all the challenges will be freed from AI control... and deemed worthy to lead the rebuilding of the planet.

Be prepared. The future of humanity is at stake.
